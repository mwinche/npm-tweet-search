npm-tweet-search
================

Used to fetch data from twitter with given api credentials

### Tokens

This module requires you to install properly obtained tokens from
dev.twitter.com. Once you have created an app and authenticated it
against your account, run `npm run tokens` and copy/paste the requested
tokens from the new app into the script. This will install the tokens for
you in a way such that they will not be made public.
